    "EXT. STREET - NIGHT",
    "DAMOCLES has almost reached a bench. We run to catch up and sit down next to them, panning over as they use a red lighter on a white cigarette. They take a long drag, and we turn to watch their exhale hang in the night air.",
    "INT. BATHHOUSE - NIGHT",
    "The smoke has become steam, thick in the air of a men's sauna. DAMOCLES struts by wearing only a white towel and red locker-key. The hallway is lined with men wearing black leather masks leering out of open doors. We stretch away from DAMOCLES as they open a door, revealing a bright white light. They look at us, confused. Suddenly, red-covered arms reach out, pulling DAMOCLES inside and slamming the door. We dilate into it, pounding without limbs.",
    "INT. BATHHOUSE - NIGHT",
    "The door bursts open. We behold DAMOCLES in a red leather mask, using a red strap-on to fuck STRANGER. DAMOCLES's thrusts intensify as STRANGER switches from moans to yelps.",
    "STRANGER",
    "Stop! RED!",
    "STRANGER pushes DAMOCLES off and catches their breath.",
    "STRANGER",
    "What the fuck is your damage?",
    "STRANGER exits the room as we kneel by DAMOCLES.",
    "INT. HOUSE - NIGHT",
    "DAMOCLES tears their mask off, and stares at us begging for understanding. The whistle of a kettle prompts DAMOCLES to stand up, back in their house wearing the white robe, and exit. We raise up and note the red leather mask mounted above the door before following.",
    "INT. HOUSE - NIGHT",
    "DAMOCLES finishes making tea and sits in their chair. We move behind them and see the TV is off. As DAMOCLES drinks, the TV turns on to display another 'Breaking News Alert' and cuts to REPORTER with a graphic of DAMOCLES above their shoulder. The white subtitles from this message start overflow across the screen.",
    "REPORTER",
    "New allegations against our beloved mayoral candidate, but what is this 'victim' hiding?",
    "The graphic now shows DAMOCLES in their mask. We move toward the TV until its image fills our view. The subtitles have started to layer, turning red and bold.",
    "REPORTER",
    "KNOWN DEVIANT- TRANNY SADIST- WE'LL BURN YOUR LIFE DOWN-",
    "A full-screen version of the DIONYSIUS graphic splays across the TV, credits roll. The TV turns off and we see DAMOCLES's reflection in the empty screen."
