    "We head outside and turn back to see FAMILIAR watching DAMOCLES shove their feet into shoes and leap out the door.",
    "DAMOCLES walks right for us, and we slide out of the way again. This time is different; we make eye contact with DAMOCLES as they slam us into the side of the building. Screaming as they punch the white wall next to our head twice. They stagger off of us and into the night. We shove off the wall, looking where the punches landed to see fresh blood on a new impact site and dried blood on several old ones."
