    "We follow DAMOCLES home as they fish headphones out of their pocket. Street noises dim as jaunty music starts. Passing pedestrians take an interest, doing double-takes or gesturing. Lyrics in some english facsimile start as the song grows increasingly saccharine. DAMOCLES reaches their door and starts to unlock it as a message alert cuts through the incongruous medley once, then twice before we understand. DAMOCLES checks their phone, then runs inside."
