    "The smoke has become steam, thick in the air of a men's sauna. DAMOCLES struts by wearing only a white towel and red locker-key. The hallway is lined with men wearing black leather masks leering out of open doors. We stretch away from DAMOCLES as they open a door, revealing a bright white light. They look at us, confused. Suddenly, red-covered arms reach out, pulling DAMOCLES inside and slamming the door. We dilate into it, pounding without limbs."
