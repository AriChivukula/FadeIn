    "REPORTER's voice muffles as we turn to frame DAMOCLES sitting in the chair, wearing a white robe, glass of liquor in hand. We hear a scrape as the door behind DAMOCLES unbolts and swings open to reveal FAMILIAR.",
    "FAMILIAR",
    "I'm hoooome!",
    "They're dressed smartly in dark colors; back from work with arms full of groceries. FAMILIAR nudges the door closed, places bags on a console, keys on a hook above it, and carefully unlaces their shoes. Routine complete, FAMILIAR leans back on the door to catch their breath. Their calm is interrupted as they register the news. Blinking, FAMILIAR leans off the wall and cautiously approaches DAMOCLES's chair. As they close in their voice starts to wash out into a suffocating buzz.",
    "We draw closer to DAMOCLES, their head out of view, and their chair obscuring everything behind them. FAMILIAR reaches down to reassuringly squeeze DAMOCLES's shoulders. It's suddenly silent, except for the sound of rustling fabric. The hands slide down DAMOCLES's front in a possessive caress as FAMILIAR's newly red shirt comes into view. DAMOCLES slackens under this embrace as FAMILIAR's arms work their way into a chokehold on DAMOCLES. The tightening of this vice jerks DAMOCLES back into the world, jumping as they spin around."
